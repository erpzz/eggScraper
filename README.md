# eggScraper
egg price scraper, tracking and saving to database before analysis. At the moment this is only compatible with Target's website however this will change in the future along with the supported grocery items. 

This program is still a work in progress. This is my first attempt at building a scraper. Eventually I would like to refactor so others could adjust it and use this code however for now it is mostly for display purposes. That being said, feel free to try it out! 

You might have to adjust the zipCode because it is temporarily hard coded. This can be changed by uncommenting the line which prompts you to enter a zip, and deleting the line that set the zipcode value.

Without the required dependencies this program will not work. 

to install required dependencies open terminal and type:

pip install -r requirements.txt
